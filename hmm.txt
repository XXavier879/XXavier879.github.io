Words dont make a change
Images neither
Because you cant just manipulate people with a simple "dont give up" so they dont give up
People arent all going to do what you tell them to, even if they want to

Telling people to read a book is not motivational, neither modern I know, books are good for you But computers and phones are not bad but saying "phone bad, book good" with an image and putting "motivational images" in the caption is not true, neither "one image, a thousand words" thats just stupidity and interaction farming

At this point telling somenone "give up" will make them not give up, unless they actually do that because they always want to give up Something useful is telling people to not do what you want them to do, because most of people will do it anyways

Most of people who upload "motivational" images or images that "tell a thousand words" dont even know what the image says, or maybe even arent people

Facebook is a useless platform wich now is mostly made to keep moms distracted and make older people dumb

Youtube kids now is mostly p*rnhub but animated, as there are the "tv woman has kids with skibidi toilet"

Saying "using your phone makes you worse at school" actually im smarter from stuff i learned while using my phone, while at school its just stuff that is like general

Why does youtube kids allow animated p*rn while normal youtube doesnt allow you to say "fuck"

Google is trying to push too many ads onto people, this will end up making google need to sell some stuff, or maybe get in trouble

At this point, the anarchistic side of the internet is safer than the ruled one

I feel like its safer to go onto reddit than onto wikipedia

Safer to search with ublock origin that without it

Using a modded youtube client Using a modded chrome client Just because google is ruining the internet, as much as they made it better You cant use another option than google, because google is integrated with so many things, its the default

Companies like meta, google, apple, samsung, etc are ruining the world, maybe samsung should try to go further away from that, they can still escape from it, the big monster that changes companies into ruining themselves, leaving people with no choice shouldnt be a common, marketting should not be made a mainstream thing Google shouldnt own everything Internet is not bad, but what is in it can be Google and their sub companies arent searching for your safety, but for places to put ads, and money

At this point if you trapped me in a simulation i whould be happier, because there the happyness you see online becomes true But these things need to be fixed To make the world as good as the ads show it

Make apps useful Try to make the world feel great again Try by starting to fix the issues with ai music and art, just limit it to certain people Dont advance ai art, its bad

Dont "innovate" in ai videos, those are bad too for many reasons Ai audio is dangerous for many reasons, but it still has some safe uses

Try to make less profit of ads and paid stuff, try to be non-profit, you already got enought money, try to make stuff convenient Try to fix inflation Try to make people not have to use weapons Try to make the world safe, while still having less rules This whould fix war, tho not world hunger We could try to fix that, with all kinds of science, not bombing a place, just make more places to grow food Do not get angry over chemicals in your food, because everything is chemicals already Do not seek to break the rules, if you want to, there should be a place to do it without disturbing people

Capitalism is useless But comunism is too We need to make an in-between that doesnt want more and more money while still being good to everyone, while everyone gets what they work for, companies could still exist, but not stack money for themselves

We dont need world leaders, at this point i hope idk google and microsoft and samsung start workin on a supercomputer the size of a small city to run a worldwide simulation, and make cheap immersive vr Because i feel like living in a simulation is better than living in real life But an optional simulation A connected one

If everyone needs to live in vrchat for this to be possible, im ok with it If all devices over the world need to make a network for this to work Im ok with it

Make "surfing the web" true Make searching for stuff online something impressive, make squewmorphism Im ok if the world goes into virtual insanity Make it optional to be in the simulation Like you can enter and leave What i mean is basicly that vr becomes accessible, to let people escape from reality
